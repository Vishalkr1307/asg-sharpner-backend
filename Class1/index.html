    <p>Throughout this course, we'll write a lot of code. And to give you the possibility of comparing your code to mine (to find + fix potential errors in your code), you'll find <strong>multiple code snapshots per module</strong> attached to lectures in this course.</p><p>The <strong>last lecture of each module</strong> always holds <strong>all snapshots</strong> for the module, ordered chronologically.</p><p>You can view the code and compare it to yours or replace (parts of) your code with it temporarily (to narrow down the issue).</p><p><strong>How do you use the attached code?</strong></p><p><strong>BEFORE</strong> we started using npm, you simply run the main .js file via node - just as we do it in the videos. Or you simply look into the code files to view + compare the code.</p><p><strong>AFTER</strong> we started using npm, you need to run <code>npm install</code> inside of the extracted code attachment before you can run npm start to run the server.</p>

    <p>As a student of this course you also get free access to our "<strong>Academind Community</strong>" on Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/gxvEWGU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/gxvEWGU</a></p><p>There, you can find <strong>like-minded people</strong>, <strong>discuss</strong> issues, <strong>help each other</strong>, share progress, successes and ideas and simply have a good time!</p><p>I&nbsp;believe that you learn the most if you don't learn alone but find learning partners and other people with similar interests. Our community is a great place for this - it's the <strong>perfect complimentary resource for this course</strong>. </p><p>Joining it is of course free and 100% optional.</p>
    <p>At the moment, the Node webpage (nodejs.org)&nbsp;which we're going to use in the next lecture looks different. </p><p>This will only be the case temporarily (as you can tell if you visit the page) but in the meantime, since you're going to need to download NodeJS&nbsp;from the site, here's the download link:&nbsp;<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></p><p>We'll need that in the next lecture.</p>
